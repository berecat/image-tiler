# ImageTiler
A project for dividing images into ùëö √ó ùëõ tiles while keeping their annotations
(polygons, Bounding boxes) in the correct form. Image tiling is typically used
for detecting small objects in high-resolution images. Some segmentation algorithms only accept
fixed picture sizes. In these cases, we resize the picture by default which might end up in a loss of details. 
Tiling images helps preserve the details but breaks down your image into smaller tiles. 
This option works best when your objects' micro and macro visual features are very similar, i.e., Cracks, Corrosion, etc. 
But it only works well with objects that require visual continuity, like humans.<br>

# Features
* Three different tiling methods: default, overlapping, and padding
* Support for annotations such as polygons and bounding boxes
* Support building tiles from image paths, bytes, and files on MinIO Object Storage


# Getting Started

## Installing

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hossshakiba/ImageTiler.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here is a sample code of using ImageTiler:
> Note: Annotations must be in COCO format
```python
# read image annotations (polygons or bounding boxes)
with open('annotations.json', 'r') as file:
    polygons = json.loads(file.read())
    
# create ImageTilingFactory object with desired tiling parameters
obj = ImageTilingFactory(
    polygons=polygons,
    tile_width=650,
    tile_height=650,
    tiling_type="overlapping"
)

# build the tiles
obj.build_tiles_from_file('images/pandas.jpg')

# draw new annotations on tiles and save them in tiles folder
for image, annotation in zip(obj.tiled_image_files, obj.tiled_annotations):
    image_file, image_file_name = image[0], image[1]
    visualize_keypoints(image_file, annotation, f'tiles/{image_file_name}')
```

## Results
The results of the project are organized into different folders, each containing the results of a specific tiling method:
* default
* overlapping
* padding

The following annotated image is divided into tiles with different methods:
<p class="row" float="left" align="middle">
  <img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/images/pandas.png" title="confusion matrix"/>
</p>
Here are four samples of generated 650 √ó 650 tiles with overlapping method:<br><br>
<p class="row" align="middle">
  <img src="/overlapping_tiles/tiled_pandas_0_350---650_1000.jpg" width="200" height="200" /> 
  <img src="/overlapping_tiles/tiled_pandas_650_0---1300_650.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
  <img src="/overlapping_tiles/tiled_pandas_850_0---1500_650.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
  <img src="/overlapping_tiles/tiled_pandas_850_350---1500_1000.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
</p>

# Conclusion
The results of the ImageTiler project show that the tool is effective at preserving annotations in the resulting tiles, even for small objects in high-resolution images. The evaluation results demonstrate that the tool can support object detection in high-resolution images. Though trying different methods and tiling sizes based on your images is always suggested to get the best result.

# Future Work
- Sometimes there are some issues with generating new annotations, especially when the original ones are overlapped. These exceptions are ignored now and do not intercept the tiling process. They should get handled in a better way
- New tiling methods can be added to the project
